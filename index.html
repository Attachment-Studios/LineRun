                LineRun is a simple geme engine and not that complex how one would imagine...
                Actually this engine was made for no purpose, but with time the devlopers still don't know why or why not to use this engine or even make it.
                Seriously talking, it is not that bad, but as it was made by the developer at the age of 16 or 17, so it might get complex. Still not bad though.
                There is also a wiki for the engine describing it's various commands.
